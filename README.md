> ## Introduction 
<p align="justify">
Zuri University employs a variety of administrative and academic professionals at various levels. The organisation has struggled with challenges associated with shifting managerial roles over the years and, hence, wants to set up an election for a leadership position in its school. They specifically stated that system should be based on the web3 technology. As a result, the organisation contacted our team for assistance in resolving the issues. The stakeholders, according to them, are:
  
  - The school board of directors
  - The teachers and Non-teaching staff
  - The students.
 
They also require that the solution proposed to them include a solution to cover the following task listed below:

> ## Task
_To Create a smart contract that enables the following:_
- _Each stakeholders should be able to vote._
- _Setup Access control for all stakeholders_
- _Only the chairman and teachers can setup and compile the result of the votes._
- _Only the chairman can grant access for the vote to happen.(There should be enable and disable vote.). If vote is disabled, no voting should take place._
- _students should not see result of votes until made public by the other stakeholders._
